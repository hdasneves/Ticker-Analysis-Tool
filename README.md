This repository represents an application in which you can analyse a ticker or compare two tickers (graphs, return, volatility, KPI's...). You can also export the data into a csv file.

Download the files, put them in the same repertory and launch the main.py file. Don't forget to install openpyxl if you want to export data in Excel instead of CSV (pip install openpyxl).
